- 👋 Hi, I’m @repenning
- 👀 I’m interested in creating programming environment for kids. AgentSheets was the first block-based programming language. AgentCubes (3D, JavaScript) is a cool Computational Thinking Tool to create 2D/3D games and simulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make Progressive Web Applications working on mobile devices
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Collaborative Computational Thinking Tools
